<Expandable title="Already using Sentry for Android? Here are some recent highlights">

We released <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/perf-v2/">Performance-V2</PlatformLink>
, a set of experimental features to give you more details about app start performance and frame delay on a span level.

We released <PlatformLink to="/enhance-errors/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink>, which shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames.

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Android%2CType%3A+Bug&template=bug_report_android.yml).

On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Android SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

We recommend installing the SDK through our [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i android
```

This will patch your project and configure the SDK. You only need to patch the project once, then you can add the patched files to your version control system.
If you prefer, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink> or follow the instructions below to adapt the [configuration](#configure).

<Expandable title="The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard">

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It'll then automatically do the following steps for you:

- update your app's `build.gradle` file with the Sentry Gradle plugin and configure it
- update your `AndroidManifest.xml` with the default Sentry configuration
- create `sentry.properties` with an auth token to upload proguard mappings (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example error to your app's Main Activity to verify your Sentry setup

</Expandable>

## Configure

Additional options can be found <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">on our dedicated options page</PlatformLink>.

Here, you'll also be able to set context data, which includes data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink>, all of which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.

## Verify

Verify that your app is sending events to Sentry by adding the following snippet, which includes an intentional error. You should see the error reported in Sentry within a few minutes.

```java
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import java.lang.Exception;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    try {
      throw new Exception("This is a test.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import io.sentry.Sentry

class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    try {
      throw Exception("This is a test.")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
      Sentry.captureException(e)
    }
  }
}
```
