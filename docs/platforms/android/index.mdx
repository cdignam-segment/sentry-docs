<Expandable title="Already using Sentry for Android? Here are some recent highlights">

We released <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/perf-v2/">Performance-V2</PlatformLink>
, a set of experimental features to give you more details about app start performance and frame delay on a span level.

We released <PlatformLink to="/enhance-errors/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink>, which shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames.

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Android%2CType%3A+Bug&template=bug_report_android.yml).

On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i android
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It'll then automatically do the following steps for you:

- update your app's `build.gradle` file with the Sentry Gradle plugin and configure it
- update your `AndroidManifest.xml` with the default Sentry configuration
- create `sentry.properties` with an auth token to upload proguard mappings (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example error to your app's Main Activity to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled exceptions, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Note>

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

## Configure

Additional options can be found <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">on our dedicated options page</PlatformLink>.

Here, you'll also be able to set context data, which includes data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink>, all of which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<Note>

If you're using [automatic installation via the wizard](/platforms/android/#install), this step isn't necessary.

</Note>

```java
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import java.lang.Exception;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    try {
      throw new Exception("This is a test.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import io.sentry.Sentry

class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    try {
      throw Exception("This is a test.")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
      Sentry.captureException(e)
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
